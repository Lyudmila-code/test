                Jennifer is a sweet 2 months old Labrador that is patiently
                waiting to find a new forever home. This girl really enjoys
                being able to go outside to run and play, but won't hesitate to
                play up a storm in the house if she has all of her favorite
                toys.

            This cute boy, Charly, is three years old and he likes adults and
            kids. He isn’t fond of many other dogs, so he might do best in a
            single dog home. Charly has lots of energy, and loves to run and
            play. We think a fenced yard would make him very happy.
